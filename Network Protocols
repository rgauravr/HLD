   Protocol used: 
    Application Layer: 
	                  HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.

	                  Web socket: Used in a messaging/chat kind of application.
					  Defination: Web socket is a network-communication protocol that was specially designed to work over Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). The sockets open in a two-way channel â€” client and server. This creates a hotline between them leading to two endpoints. It has a different mechanism as compared to TCP/IP communication because instead of multiple separate requests, there is a single request with the two-way transfer of data. And the most important leverage to have with the web sockets is that the connection lasts until either client or the server closes it or if the network drops.

                      Note: Websockets is used in case of streaming and server pushed the data to the client even when the client has not requested for any data.

    Transport Layer: 
	                UDP: User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a Transport Layer protocol. UDP is a part of the Internet Protocol suite, referred to as UDP/IP suite. Unlike TCP, it is an unreliable and connectionless protocol. So, there is no need to establish a connection prior to data transfer. The UDP helps to establish low-latency and loss-tolerating connections establish over the network.The UDP enables process to process communication

					TCP:The Internet Protocol (IP) is the address system of the Internet and has the core function of delivering packets of information from a source device to a target device. IP is the primary way in which network connections are made, and it establishes the basis of the Internet. IP does not handle packet ordering or error checking. Such functionality requires another protocol, often the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).

2>Peer to Peer

   In the P2P network architecture, the computers connect with each other in a workgroup to share files, and access to internet and printers. 

   Each computer in the network has the same set of responsibilities and capabilities.
   Each device in the network serves as both a client and server.
   The architecture is useful in residential areas, small offices, or small companies where each computer act as an independent workstation and stores the data on its hard drive. 
   Each computer in the network has the ability to share data with other computers in the network.
   The architecture is usually composed of workgroups of 12 or more computers.
