Filtering:
---------
Filtering in REST API refers to the process of limiting the result set of an API request based on specific criteria.
Filtering allows clients of a REST API to retrieve only the data they need, and can be used to improve the performance of the API and reduce the amount of data transmitted over the network.

There are several ways to implement filtering in a REST API:

Path parameters
Query parameters
Request body


Sorting
-------
Sorting in REST API refers to the ability to arrange the data returned by a REST API endpoint in a specific order, either in ascending or descending order, based on one or more fields.
This allows clients to request the data in a desired order, making it easier to find what they are looking for. 

The specific sorting mechanism used by a REST API will depend on the API's design and implementation.
Ascending sorting
Descending sorting
Multiple column sorting

Paging
------
Pagination in REST API refers to the process of dividing a large number of results into smaller parts (known as pages) and sending them to the client in separate requests. This helps to manage the size of response data and reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network.
The client can request a specific page by including parameters in the API request that specify the desired page number and the number of items per page.

This approach helps to reduce network bandwidth usage and improve the speed and efficiency of API requests.
Offset Pagination
Cursor-based Pagination
Keyset Pagination
Seek Pagination
