Fault: a fault is a defect or abnormal situation in a component of a system that deviates from its specifications.
Eg Lets say there is a aeroplane which had 4 engine and if one of the engine failes then its a fault and fault will be tolerated by other 3 engine. 

Failure: A failure is when the system doesn't provide its service to the user or provides an unacceptably degraded service.
eg
when aeroplane crashes due to unfortunate situation, its an example of failure and we will use safety jacket to handle the failure.
