Defination:
Event-driven architecture is a dynamic approach that orchestrates software systems based on real-time events and interactions. Unlike conventional architectures, EDA fosters a decentralized model of communication characterized by loosely coupled components that respond to events. Thus, EDA transforms traditional monolithic structures into agile, event-responsive ecosystems.

For instance, consider a retail application utilizing EDA. When a customer places an order, an event is triggered, setting off a chain of actions. This could involve updating inventory, processing payments, and notifying the customer. In other words, EDA ensures that every step is initiated by relevant events, resulting in a streamlined and efficient process.

Furthermore, EDA enables systems to handle complex scenarios with ease. Letâ€™s say an intelligent home system detects a sudden temperature drop. Through EDA, this event can trigger multiple responses: adjusting the thermostat, notifying the homeowner, and activating heating devices. Such specific and simultaneous reactions exemplify the power of EDA.
