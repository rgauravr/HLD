In the P2P network architecture, the computers connect with each other in a workgroup to share files, and access to internet and printers. 

Each computer in the network has the same set of responsibilities and capabilities.
Each device in the network serves as both a client and server.
The architecture is useful in residential areas, small offices, or small companies where each computer act as an independent workstation and stores the data on its hard drive. 
Each computer in the network has the ability to share data with other computers in the network.
The architecture is usually composed of workgroups of 12 or more computers.
