API throttling is the process of limiting the number of API requests a user can make in a certain period. An application programming interface (API) functions as a gateway between a user and a software application. For example, when a user clicks the post button on social media, the button click triggers an API call. This API interacts with the web server of the social media application and performs the action of posting. This user could be a human or another software application.
