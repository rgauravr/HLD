Database migrations, also known as schema migrations, database schema migrations, or simply migrations, are controlled sets of changes developed to modify the structure of the objects within a relational database. Migrations help transition database schemas from their current state to a new desired state, whether that involves adding tables and columns, removing elements, splitting fields, or changing types and constraints.

Migrations manage incremental, often reversible, changes to data structures in a programmatic way. The goals of database migration software are to make database changes repeatable, shareable, and testable without loss of data. Generally, migration software produces artifacts that describe the exact set of operations required to transform a database from a known state to the new state. These can be checked into and managed by normal version control software to track changes and share among team members.
