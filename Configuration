Configuration in system design is a type of design that involves combining a set of predefined components in specific ways to create a system. The components are physical devices that are typically selected from a manufacturer's catalog. The assembly of components must meet a set of requirements and adhere to a set of constraints. 
In terms of computers and technology, configuration refers to the arrangement of an IT system's hardware and software. Managing the components and settings ensures that all IT systems can function smoothly.
