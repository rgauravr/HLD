Logging:

Logging in system design refers to the practice of recording events, messages, or activities that occur within a software application or system. These logs provide a detailed history of what has transpired, offering valuable insights into the system's behavior, performance, and potential issues.

Monitoring:
System monitoring involves the continuous monitoring of an IT system by an IT manager. It includes monitoring the performance and availability of important network devices, such as CPU, Server memory, Routers, Switches, Bandwidth, Applications.

Monitoring in system design refers to the process of observing, checking, and analyzing the behavior and performance of a system to ensure that it operates as intended and meets specified requirements. Monitoring is a crucial aspect of system design, as it allows for the identification of issues, performance bottlenecks, and potential failures in real-time or over a period.

Key aspects of monitoring in system design include:

Performance Monitoring:

Resource Usage: Tracking the utilization of system resources such as CPU, memory, disk space, and network bandwidth to ensure optimal performance.
Response Times: Measuring the time it takes for the system to respond to requests, ensuring that it meets performance expectations.
Error Monitoring:

Error Logs: Recording and analyzing error messages or log files to identify issues, troubleshoot problems, and improve system stability.
Alerts and Notifications: Setting up alerts for specific events or thresholds to notify administrators or users when something goes wrong or when predefined conditions are met.
Security Monitoring:

Intrusion Detection: Monitoring for suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts to identify potential security threats.
Audit Trails: Keeping track of user actions and system changes to maintain accountability and detect security breaches.
Availability Monitoring:

Uptime Monitoring: Tracking the system's availability and reliability to ensure it meets service-level agreements (SLAs).
Failover and Redundancy: Monitoring failover mechanisms and redundant components to ensure high availability.
Capacity Planning:

Scalability: Monitoring the system's ability to scale and handle increased loads, helping with capacity planning to accommodate future growth.
Resource Trends: Analyzing historical data to predict future resource requirements and optimize system performance.
Application-Specific Monitoring:

Custom Metrics: Monitoring metrics specific to the application or service being run, such as transaction rates, user activity, or custom performance indicators.
User Experience Monitoring:

End-User Monitoring: Evaluating the user experience by monitoring aspects like page load times, responsiveness, and user interactions.
Effective monitoring often involves the use of specialized tools and software that collect, analyze, and visualize relevant data. These tools help system administrators and developers proactively address issues, optimize performance, and ensure the overall health and reliability of the system.
