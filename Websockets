Defination: Web socket is a network-communication protocol that was specially designed to work over Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). The sockets open in a two-way channel â€” client and server. This creates a hotline between them leading to two endpoints. It has a different mechanism as compared to TCP/IP communication because instead of multiple separate requests, there is a single request with the two-way transfer of data. And the most important leverage to have with the web sockets is that the connection lasts until 
either client or the server closes it or if the network drops.

Note: Websockets is used in case of streaming and server pushed the data to the client even when the client has not requested for any data.
